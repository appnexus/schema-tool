Schema Tool helps manage database alter history in a framework-agnostic
way that works well for both large and small teams. The tool uses the concept of a linear
alter chain to track the order in which alters should be (or have been) applied.  It does so
by giving each alter a `backref` that points at a previous alter in the alter chain.  The
alter chain must remain linear.  (In Git metaphors, this is akin to requiring a fast-forward
and disallowing a merge.)  The features of the tool aim to allow developers to
write alter code in their respective branches, easily and safely merge that
code into the main alter chain, and finally run those alters on target databases (dev, QA, production, etc).

Currently the tool supports MySQL and Postgres (Vertica & Hive are a WIP).

The key features of the tool are:

+ Manage alter chains (parents and children) and provide check/resolve tools to enforce these chains are correct
+ Automatically run alters to setup, teardown, or rebuild your database
+ Determine what environment alters are allowed to run in
+ Keep track of a history of what alters have been run in the database for easy programatic usage

One thing that the tool is not, and does not try to be, is a domain-specific language for making alters. SQL
is an excellent DSL already, so there is no need for that.


## Requirements

+ `mysql` client CLI, used to run alter files
+ `pgsql` client CLI, used to run alter files

## Getting Started

Schema-tool is written in Go and thus can be installed as a single, pre-compiled binary or through the
Go toolchain.

### Pre-Compiled Binary
```shell
mkdir -p ~/bin
curl -o ~/bin/schema https://TODO: get GitHub URL for releases
chmod +x ~/bin/schema

# Make sure to add this to your .bashrc/.zshrc/etc
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
```

Releases exist for the following platform and architectures.

Platform | Supported Architectures |
---------|-------------------------|
Linux    | `amd64`, `386`          |
Mac OS   | `amd64`, `386`          |
Windows  | `amd64`, `386`          |

### Go Toolchain
Since the schema-tool is built with Go, you can install using the `go get` command via:

```bash
go get -u github.com/appnexus/schema-tool
```

### Creating a New Project

If you are creating a new project, you can simply do the following:

```shell
mkdir my-schemas
cd my-schemas/
git init

# for MySQL
cp ~/bin/schema-tool/conf/config.json.mysql-template config.json
# or, for Postgres
cp ~/bin/schema-tool/conf/config.json.pgsql-template config.json
# or, for Vertica
cp ~/bin/schema-tool/conf/config.json.vertica-template config.json

# edit appropriately
vim config.json
```


Here is the content of the MySQL config file template:

```json
{
    "username": "root",
    "password": "root",
    "host": "localhost",
    "revision_db_name": "revision",
    "history_table_name": "history",
    "port": 3306,
    "type": "mysql"
}
```


It should be pretty self-explanatory except for the revision database and the history table. These fields specify
where the tool will keep track of what alters have been run. You can set these values to whatever
names you would like - the tool takes care of creating the database and table.

Once your configuration file is correct, you are ready to take a tour of the tool and create your first
alter. You can find all the commands supported by the tool by reading the help-file, which
you can get to via `schema -h`. You should see the following:

```text
Usage: schema command [options]

Commands:
  new         Create a new alter
  check       Check that all back-refs constitute a valid chain
  list        List the current alter chain
  up          Bring up to particular revision
  down        Roll back to a particular revision
  rebuild     Run the entire database down and back up (hard refresh)
  gen-ref     Generate new file-ref
  gen-sql     Generate SQL for a given reference, including revision-history alter(s)
  resolve     Resolve a divergent-branch conflict (found by 'check' command)
  init        Initialize new project
  version     Shows current version of tool
  help        Show this help message and exit

Options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

Additionally each command also has its own help file. For example, if you wanted to see what
options are available to you when applying an alter, you can could `schema up -h` and see:

```text
Usage: schema up [options] [ref]

Arguments
  ref               Run all alters up to, and including, the ref given

Options:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -n N, --number=N  Run N number of up-alters from current state - overrides
                    arguments
  -f, --force       Continue running up-alters even if an error has occurred
  -v, --verbose     Output verbose error-messages when used with -f option if
                    errors are encountered
  -u, --no-undo     When comparing histories (of what has ran and what is to
                    be ran) do not undo any previously ran alters
```

To get started and create your first file, simply run:

```shell
schema init
schema new -f init
```

The `init` will take care of setting up the `revision` database and `history` table (or whatever you
configured them to be) and any janitorial tasks. The `new` will create an `up` and `down` file
that will look something like this:

```text
137823105930-init-down.sql
137823105930-init-up.sql
```

The number at the front is the identifier that is used to keep the alter chain in line (see next
section on understanding the chain). You can now edit the files (including whatever alter you have)
and apply them against your local database by running `schema up`.

Now you're up and running! You can add more files with `schema new` and control the state of your
database with `up`, `down`, and `rebuild` commands.

## Understanding The Alter Chain

To understand how the tool does its job, you have to understand how it thinks about alters.
When working with alters, it's easy to have dependencies between alters such that order is
very important. The way that the tool addresses this is by giving each alter a unique reference
and each alter specifies its parent alter by that reference. The parent relationship
specifies that the parent alter should be applied before the child alter. This creates a singly-
linked list where the tail is the first alter to be run and the head is the last alter to be
run:

```text
A <----- B <----- C <----- D <----- E <----- F
```

A valid alter chain does not have any branching such that a parent has multiple children.
This can arise in situations where you might have created a separate feature-branch in your
version control system and merged it back to the mainline after some time of development in
which the mainline branch had advanced in the interim:

```text
A <----- B <----- C  <----- F
                  ^\
                    \ <----- D <----- E
```

The `check` command will alert you to any inconsistencies in your alter chain like that which
is defined above. The `resolve` command will help you resolve such issues if they are found.
More on that later.

Note that each node in the alter chain is actually a pair of alters.
One item in the pair is the up alter and the other item is the down alter. The actual structure
would look like:

```text
Up:    A <----- B <----- C <----- D <----- E <----- F
       ∧        ∧        ∧        ∧        ∧        ∧
       |        |        |        |        |        |
       ∨        ∨        ∨        ∨        ∨        ∨
Down:  A <----- B <----- C <----- D <----- E <----- F
```

The alters are given refs, rather than incremental numbers, because it makes things a
little easier to track within the database in terms of what has been applied. When working with
multiple branches, the incremental numbers may not represent the correct set of alters that
have been applied to the database. This is important when updating that the user knows he is up
to date with the correct alters.

## Running Alters (up / down / rebuild)

You can run alters by using the `up`, `down`, and `rebuild` commands. The `rebuild` command
will run all the way down and all the way back up. There are some common options you should
be aware of that each command supports:

+ `-v` outputs verbose error messages
+ `-f` will ignore errors and move on to running the next alter
+ `-n` (only on `up` and `down`) specifies the number of alters to run from current point
+ `ref` you can provide a reference number to run up/down to. For rebuild it will run down to
  this commit and back up (inclusively)

You may run into errors when switching branches often because the tool will get confused on
what may or may not have ran against your database. Most of the time you can get around this by
running `schema rebuild -fv`.

## Checking and Resolving the Alter Chain

Running the `check` command will let you know if you have a divergent branch. Typically this
is the result of merging two branches or rebasing against your stable branch from your
feature branch. The `check` command will tell you where the branch occurs and list the two
alters that are in question. If you know which alter is at fault (typically the new alter)
then you can simply run:

```shell
schema resolve OFFENDING_ALTER_HASH
```

This will move the offending alter (and any alters that come after it in the sub-chain)
to the end of the alter chain. One thing to note is that if you resolve the incorrect
alter, then you may end up with an order-of events that does not make sense.

## DBA Alter Generation

If you work in a large organization or with a mission-critical RDBMS then your database administrators (DBAs) may,
understandably, be hesitant to use any tool to auto-magically run alters against the
production environment. However, it still would be nice to take advantage of the
revision-tracking functionality this tool provides in your production environment. This tool
provides the best of both worlds. Your DBAs can use plain alters (and whatever tools
they choose) and you can track what revisions have run against your production database. This
can be done with the `gen-sql` command.

The `gen-sql` command generates a set of alters, from your original alters, with SQL
added to directly manage insertions and deletions into the revision table. To get started you need to
ensure that your schema project is setup correctly for static alter genration.

> __Assumptions:__
> + All commands are performed within the root directory of the schema project that
    _you_ created (as per the __Getting Started__ section)
> + The `config.json` (config file) is located within the project root

+ Edit your config.json to include the following two keys:
```json
"static_alter_dir": "DBA_FILES/"
"pre_commit_hook": "pre-commit-hook-static-dba-files.sh"
```
+ Copy the pre-commit hook from the schema-tool's contrib to your schema-dir:
```shell
cp SCHEMA-TOOL-REPO/contrib/pre-commit-hook-static-dba-files.sh .
```
+ Use the schema-tool to install the hook and perform any needed setup:
```shell
schema init
```
+ Perform initial generation (for any existing alter):
```shell
schema gen-sql -qw  # Generates static 'up' alters from existing 'up' alters
schema gen-sql -qwd # Generates static 'down' alters from existing 'down' alters
```

Now that you have the hook installed, you will see auto-generated files show up
each time you commit a new (or edit an existing) alter.


You can look at the help-file for `gen-sql` yourself to become familiar with the
other options of the command.

## Recommended Workflow

You can use the tool any way that you see fit. However, we've found that it works quite
well when you work with feature branches. In this workflow all new work is done on a feature
branch and `master` becomes the stable branch. When an atler is completed (tested / reviewed)
you can rebase against `master` and then run a `schema check` followed by a `schema resolve`
if necessary. When you merge to master you ensure that the feature branch is up-to-date.

In this way you avoid merges with `master` (and thus divergent alter chains) and ensure that
`master` is clean (and ideally stable). You can further enforce this workflow with testing
(ensuring that all the alters can be run) such as [Jenkins][1] and [Gerrit][2] (to enforce
the rebase-based workflow).
